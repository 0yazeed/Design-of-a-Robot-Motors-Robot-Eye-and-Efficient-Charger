# Controlling Robot Motors Using L298N



### Used equipments

* Arduino
* L298N Motor Driver
* 2 motors 
* **11.1 V & 2200mAH** Battery 



### Implementation Steps

At first, I connect the Arduino and L298N ports as following: 
| Arduino     | L298N |
| ---      | ---       |
| 13       | Enaple A  |
| 12       | IN1       |
| 11       | IN2       |
| 10       | IN3       |
| 9        | IN4       |
| 8        | Enaple b  |


After that, I connect the two motors in L298N ports <out1,(out2),(out3),(out4)>
